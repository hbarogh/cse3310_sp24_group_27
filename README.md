# Word Search Game
This game I worked on with 5 other people. It is a word search game that is run with a websocket server, it can support multiple users and multiple games at a time, has real time chat functionality, and a leaderboard as well. This code was created with Java, Javasript, HTML, and CSS. 


```bash
% export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.18.0.9-0.3.ea.el8.x86_64
% mvn clean
% mvn compile
% mvn package
% mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=uta.cse3310.App
```
